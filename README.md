# materialize-demos and template

This a small directory of Google Material Design demos I'm working on, to review and stay organized with Material components.

I may make a separate template build repository, but for now, if you are looking for a Materialize template, I adapted this from the Scoth tutorial + the Materialize getting stated + my own template code.

Initial check in a simple starter template, with the proper CDN javascript libraries and basic file structure.

- clone original check-in from github
- npm install
